DDC Assignment: timed challenge

Instructions:

Write an instrument class as a parent for a musical instrument.

Then create two child classes for the lulz.

Finally create a tune trait that tunes a stringy instrument; use that trait in one of your child classes.

The challenging part of this challenge is the assignment - it's very vague; let the project talk to you, be creative, and have fun.
